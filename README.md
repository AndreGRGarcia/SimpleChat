# SimpleChat
A chat application made with java and the swing framework.

 I first made this project so I would understand how Sockets worked and how to use them with threads to make a working application. Later I wanted to find out how to send files through the socket, so the client asks the server to download 2 sound files, a startup sound and a notification sound. The location of the files is the only argument that the server object takes.
